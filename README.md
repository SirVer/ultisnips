UltiSnips
=========

UltiSnips is the ultimate solution for snippets in Vim. It has many features,
speed being one of them.

![GIF Demo](https://raw.github.com/SirVer/ultisnips/master/doc/demo.gif)

In this demo I am editing a python file. I first expand the `#!` snippet, then
the `class` snippet. The completion menu comes from
[YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe), UltiSnips also
integrates with [deoplete](https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim). I can
jump through placeholders and add text while the snippet inserts text in other
places automatically: when I add `Animal` as a base class, `__init__` gets
updated to call the base class constructor. When I add arguments to the
constructor, they automatically get assigned to instance variables. I then
insert my personal snippet for `print` debugging. Note that I left insert mode,
inserted another snippet and went back to add an additional argument to
`__init__` and the class snippet was still active and added another instance
variable.

The official home of UltiSnips is at <https://github.com/sirver/ultisnips>.
Please add pull requests and issues there.

UltiSnips was started in Jun 2009 by @SirVer. In Dec 2015, maintenance was
handed over to [@seletskiy](https://github.com/seletskiy) who ran out of time
in early 2017. Since Jun 2019, @SirVer is maintaining UltiSnips again on a
very constraint time budget. If you can help triaging issues it would be
greatly appreciated.


Quick Start
-----------

This assumes you are using [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim). Adapt
for your plugin manager of choice. Put this into your `.vimrc`.

    " Track the engine.
    Plugin 'SirVer/ultisnips'

    " Snippets are separated from the engine. Add this if you want them:
    Plugin 'honza/vim-snippets'

    " Trigger configuration. Do not use <tab> if you use https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe.
    let g:UltiSnipsExpandTrigger="<tab>"
    let g:UltiSnipsJumpForwardTrigger="<c-b>"
    let g:UltiSnipsJumpBackwardTrigger="<c-z>"

    " If you want :UltiSnipsEdit to split your window.
    let g:UltiSnipsEditSplit="vertical"

UltiSnips comes with comprehensive
[documentation](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips/blob/master/doc/UltiSnips.txt).
As there are more options and tons of features I suggest you at least skim it.

There are example uses for some power user features here:

  * [Snippets Aliases](doc/examples/snippets-aliasing/README.md)
  * [Dynamic Tabstops/Tabstop Generation](doc/examples/tabstop-generation/README.md)
