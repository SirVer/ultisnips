"""
This file contains object to care for the vim langmap option and basically
reverses the mappings. This was the only solution to get UltiSnips to work
nicely with langmap; other stuff I tried was using inoremap movement commands
and caching and restoring the langmap option.

Note that this will not work if the langmap overwrites a character completely,
for example if 'j' is remapped, but nothing is mapped back to 'j', then moving
one line down is no longer possible and UltiSnips will fail.
